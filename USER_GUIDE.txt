ALUMNI CONNECT HUB - NEW USER SETUP GUIDE
=======================================

Follow these steps to set up and run the Alumni Connect Hub on a new laptop.

1. PREREQUISITES
----------------
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
   - Node.js (v18 or higher): https://nodejs.org/
   - MongoDB (Community Server): https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
     (Alternatively, you can use a MongoDB Atlas cloud database URI)
   - Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - VS Code (Recommended Code Editor)

2. CLONE THE REPOSITORY
-----------------------
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to keep the project.
3. Run the command:
   git clone https://github.com/Vaishnav-188/INFRA-INNOVATORS.git alumni-connect-hub
4. Go into the project folder:
   cd alumni-connect-hub

3. WINDOWS POWERSHELL EXECUTION POLICY (If required)
----------------------------------------------------
If you run into "script cannot be loaded" errors, run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

4. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------
You need to install libraries for both the Frontend and the Backend.

A. Backend Setup:
   1. Open a terminal in the main `alumni-connect-hub` folder.
   2. Navigate to the backend:
      cd backend
   3. Install dependencies:
      npm install

B. Frontend Setup:
   1. Open a new terminal instance (keep the backend one open) or go back to the root:
      cd ..
   2. Install dependencies:
      npm install

5. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
----------------------------
You need to configure the database connection and security keys.

1. Go to the `backend` folder.
2. Create a new file named `.env`.
3. Open `.env` in Notepad or VS Code and paste the following:

   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/alumni_db
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_change_this
   JWT_EXPIRE=30d

   *(Note: If you are using MongoDB Atlas, replace the MONGODB_URI with your cloud connection string)*

6. DATABASE SETUP & INITIAL ADMIN
---------------------------------
To log in as an Admin, you need to create the first account manually.

1. Open the terminal inside the `backend` folder.
2. Run the setup script:
   node create-admin.js

   This will create a default admin account:
   - Email: admin@college.edu
   - Password: admin123(or whatever the script outputs)

7. RUNNING THE APPLICATION
--------------------------
You need to run two servers simultaneously.

Terminal 1 (Backend):
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   > You should see: "MongoDB Connected"

Terminal 2 (Frontend):
   (Make sure you are in the main folder)
   npm run dev
   > You should see: "Local: http://localhost:8080/"

8. USING THE PRODUCT
--------------------

A. Admin Login:
   1. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080/admin
   2. Login with the admin credentials created in Step 6.
   3. You will see the Admin Dashboard.

B. Importing Data (Important First Step):
   1. In the Admin Dashboard, click the "CSV" tab.
   2. Click "Select Student CSV" and upload `backend/sample-csv/students_clean.csv`.
   3. Click "Select Alumni CSV" and upload `backend/sample-csv/alumni_clean.csv`.
   4. LIMITATION NOTE: Accounts created via CSV have temporary passwords.
   5. You can download a "Credentials Report" after upload to see these accounts.

C. Student/Alumni User Flow:
   1. Users go to http://localhost:8080
   2. Student Registration: Must use `@kgkite.ac.in` email.
   3. Alumni Registration: Must use `@kgkite.alumni.ac.in` email.
   4. New registrations require Admin Approval (check "Verifications" tab in Admin Dashboard).

9. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------
- White Screen? Check the browser console (F12) for errors.
- "Connection Refused"? Ensure the Backend terminal is running and shows "MongoDB Connected".
- MongoDB Error? Open "Services" in Windows and ensure "MongoDB Server" is Running.
